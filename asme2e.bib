    abstract = "{Most fluid flows of practical applications are turbulent. In flows involving interactions with flexible structures, such as an aircraft skin, the knowledge of turbulent wall-pressure fluctuations is critical. Both measurements and direct numerical simulations of the wall-pressure fluctuations are difficult and costly. Therefore, the use of the semi-empirical turbulent wall-pressure fluctuation models is wide spread. One of the most widely used models is that due to Corcos (Resolution of Pressure in Turbulence,” J. Acoust. Soc. Am., 35(2), pp. 192–199). The biggest advantages of this model are simplicity and ease of use. However, the model has several weaknesses as well and therefore many models have been proposed to address them. In this paper, we briefly review existing models and then propose a model that remedies their weaknesses. The proposed model keeps the simplicity of the Corcos model and it is given in both space-frequency and wavenumber-frequency spaces. The new model accurately captures the convective peak and shows better agreement with experimental data at lower wavenumbers.}",

    abstract = "{The finite size of a transducer‐sensing element limits its space resolution of a pressure field associated with a local turbulent flow. Such pressure fields are translated at a speed comparable to the characteristic velocity of the flow. Consequently, a lack of resolution in space causes an apparent inability to resolve in time. This problem—an example of the mapping of a random function of several variables by a linear operator—is examined here. With the help of a formalism which has been previously discussed and of some recent experimental information about the spatial structure of turbulent pressure fields in boundary layers, the mapping or distortion of statistical quantities associated with the second‐order moments of the pressure field is given. The attenuation of the frequency spectral density and of the cross‐spectral density is given explicitly in table form and in asymptotic form. The numerical results indicate that the attenuation caused by the finite size of transducers is generally more severe than previous computations had suggested, mainly because the lateral correlation of pressure is highly frequency‐dependent, a typical turbulent pressure‐wave component being inclined to the stream direction at roughly 45 degrees.The results are applied to an evaluation of contemporary measurements of turbulent pressure fields in shear flows. It is shown that the transducer size used introduces undesirable large errors in these measurements, which lead to doubts even about the magnitude of the intensity of turbulent pressure fluctuations.Asymptotic formulas for the attenuation of large transducers are given which yield estimates of the degree to which a flush‐mounted sonar receiver immersed in a boundary layer is able to reject the background noise provided by turbulent pressure fluctuations.}",

    abstract = "{The wavenumber–frequency spectra (WFS) of turbulent wall pressure fluctuations are used to design underwater acoustic systems, and a method is presented to determine them for flat plate flow using large-eddy simulations (LES). First, the Reynolds averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) analysis is carried out for flow over the plate using   k – ω shear-stress transport model. Flow parameters are extracted from the output of this analysis and used to impose boundary conditions for large-eddy simulations using a smaller domain with finer mesh. Mesh convergence studies are done to establish the adequacy of the proposed meshing scheme for estimating the turbulent boundary layer wall pressures. The stream-wise velocity profiles, turbulence intensities, and power spectra obtained using LES are compared with other computational and experimental results. The time history of fluctuating pressure on the wall at various stream-wise locations is used to estimate the WFS. Estimations are made of the convective ridge as well as sub-convective and low wavenumber portions of the spectrum. The computations are performed at momentum thickness-based Reynolds numbers (Rθ) of 5761, 7988, and 7709. The effect of downstream distance on the WFS is studied by computing it at three downstream locations and shown that the downstream distance has little effect on the WFS once the flow has become fully turbulent. The use of a desktop workstation for the estimation of WFS has not been reported earlier. The results show that the WFS of turbulent pressure due to flow over more complex geometries can be estimated using a similar method.}",

    abstract = "{The nearfield flow noise that is generated in the boundary layer of a vehicle in water turns out to be practically, independent of the kind of vehicle that generates the turbulence. Recorded levels depend on the size and shape of the recording hydrophone, even at very low frequencies when the linear dimensions of the hydrophone are small as compared to the convection wavelength of the turbulence. At high frequencies, because of their finite size, all hydrophones become nearfield insensitive and record the radiated noise. No significant difference was observed in the radiated‐noise curve measured at a distance of about 100 ft from a rising buoyant unit, not even at frequencies as low as 150 Hz, whether the unit was of solid wood or had a thin metal shell. The radiation field depends on the second time derivative of the turbulent velocity fluctuations and, consequently, on the unsteadiness and intermittancy of the turbulence in the boundary layer. For a rotating cylinder, the measured radiation field levels approach those predicted by the recently improved Lighthill formula. For a ship, they are higher; for a buoyant unit, which is a small and a very unstable vehicle, the radiated noise becomes particularly great.}",

abstract = {Flow noise is one of the factors limiting the performance of towed array systems, especially thin-line arrays. Response of a fibre laser hydrophone array to axisymmetric boundary layer wall pressure excitation is presented. A simplified theoretical model is obtained to predict the flow noise levels inside fluid filled towed arrays. An axisymmetric wall pressure model was used along with frequency–wavenumber transfer characteristics obtained from finite element analysis (FEA) to arrive at flow noise estimates under normal operating speeds. The results were then compared with internal pressure spectra obtained from the simplified theoretical model. The flow noise levels corresponding to operating tow speeds below 2m/s for the analysed configuration are found to be lower than the nominal low-level ambient noise floor observed in the sea for frequencies greater than 200Hz. The results show that the flow noise isolation achieved through fluid filled array construction reduces with increase in tow speed.}

abstract = { Reliable acoustic path (RAP) is a direct path used for sound propagation between a shallow source and a deep receiver in deep water. The RAP environment can provide a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environment for source localization, so it has been widely studied for underwater passive detection. Active detection can be used for source localization during the descent of a vertical line array (VLA). However, the flow noise originating from the pressure fluctuations in the turbulent boundary layer (TBL) during the descent degrades the detection performance of the VLA. This paper presents a calculation of the response of the cylindrical hydrophones to axisymmetric turbulent wall pressure and the physical properties of flow noise. The flow noise was calculated using the wavenumber-frequency spectrum analysis method, which is based on Carpenter’s TBL pressure spectrum. The results show that the energy of the flow noise is concentrated mainly in low frequencies and it increases and spreads toward high frequencies with increasing stream velocity. The conclusions have been verified with experimental data. In addition, the noise correlation between two hydrophones will undergo oscillatory decay as the hydrophone spacing increases. The above findings will be beneficial for signal processing of an active sonar array.}
